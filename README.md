# ATM-simulator
This is one of my programming projects from Object Oriented Programming course at Centennial college.

# Purpose
The aim of this project was to write a C++ program that demonstrates knowledge of object-oriented programming concepts.  As such the program should use the techniques of encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance appropriately.
